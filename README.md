# UBC_GPACalculator
GPA Calculator for UBC students that only requires the user to login to their SSC account.

This personal python project uses Selenium and BeautifulSoup to web scrap the scores and credits earned from the UBC Student Service Centre (SSC) account. After running the program, it would just require the user to enter their SSC username and password in the console. The program will then login to their account using the login credentials and calculate the total credits and current GPA.

⚠️⚠️ This program doesn’t record the user’s username or password by any means ⚠️⚠️
